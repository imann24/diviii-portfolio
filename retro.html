                    <p>
                         The concept for my Division III began as a game idea. However, the more I thought about it, I realized I lacked many of the skills necessary to make a complete game. This morphed into the concept of assembling a team to make such a game, but as I considered this further, I realized Hampshire currently lacked the structure for forming such teams. This spawned the idea that would crystalize into my Division III. GlowLime Games
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         GlowLime was intended to serve students interested in game development coming from all disciplines and at all levels of experience. It would provide educational, hands-on experience in game development.

                         I believe collaboration makes for the best projects. There is the often used African Proverb: "If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." This certainly applies to game development. I’ve often found it’s quicker to throw myself into work solo without the checks and balances of a team. However, working on projects solo, especially projects as the scale of full games guarantees there will be elements missing. Working on a dedicated team offers a superior chance these elements do not go unexplored. For Design, it offers a degree of critique and fine tuning that is hard, if not impossible achieve with a solo blueprint. For Art and Audio, there is a level of quality control where acutely trained eyes and ears can survey the work being put into the game. And for programming, where I’ve spent a bulk of my time, there is a different type of quality control. Reviewing code to ensure it’s efficient, comprehensible, and maintainable.

                         Glowlime is in a large part based off the LiveCode program at Becker College by MassDiGI. Each semester, they place students on development teams to work on projects (typically pre-existing ones) and meet specific goals through the semester. The key way in which GlowLime distinguishes itself is that it’s student run. Whereas MassDiGI has a full-time team dedicated to its success, GlowLime’s Management is staffed  by students from the Five Colleges. This comes with its drawbacks and benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The benefit of having a student lead organization is the direct peer-to-peer communication. We regularly talk to our fellow students and can get feedback and input on how GlowLime as an organization is being run. This feedback loop ideally leads to an organization which meets the needs and wants of the student body at large.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         A student run organization  is not without its limitations. One of the main limiting factors is time. None of the students on the Management team can devote themselves in a fulltime capacity to the project.  The has always been a limiting factor on the scale/quantity of work GlowLime can accomplish. This is a limitation placed on all student organizations, but GlowLime runs a particular gamut between student group and startup that is hard to execute ideally. In many ways, it is a student club like any other. However, its goal is also to produce polished, professional games, and to provide students with a simulation of professional work experience
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         These expectations bring with them a degree of rigor not always found in student organizations. At many times, I feel GlowLime fell short of offering the professional standards to which it aspired. We endeavored to maintain professional production timelines, host organized events, and create polished games. There were distinct successes, but also many moments where we fell short of these goals. It was hard to motivate students participating, both at a Management level and Collaborator level to put in the necessary time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Collaborators at GlowLime are the developers who create the games. Like the Management team, the work is entirely volunteer based (though we worked w/ Ira to establish independent study credit for those students who were interested in obtaining it). Some Collaborators turned out to be exemplary workers, but others were either too inexperienced or did not have the time to commit to be a contributing member of a game development team. I think this is one of the important learning aspects of GlowLime. While the experience may be valuable for some, for others, it may show them that they don’t have the dedication or the motivation to work in games professionally. Much as GlowLime itself is an experiment in organizing groups of students to work on games, it also provides a space for students to experiment and see whether this is the kind of work they want to do professionally.

                    <p>
                         I’ve worked on five major game projects for my Division III this year:
                         <br><br><b>Fall 2016</b>
                         <ul>

                         </ul>
                         <b>Winter 2017</b>

                              </li>
                         </ul>
                         <b>Spring 2017</b>
                         <ul>
                              <li>
                                   Letters to Reid
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                   Pickup Pup
                              </li>
                         </ul>
                         All of the projects were made in Unity. Four of them were official GlowLime Games projects. The fifth was a GlowLime Match title. Three out of the five were mobile games, while the rest were targeting PC. I realize many Division III students typically focus on one game project throughout their Division III studies. For me, these different games served different purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                          <i>Defender's Light</i> was my flagship project. It was my own design and a chance for me to run a GlowLime project to the specifications I thought appropriate. I also wanted to test whether a GlowLime project could be brought from concept within a single semester of development. The results were mixed. On one hand, the game is playable and shipped. However, it was not without its compromises. Many of the art assets are still unfinished and there are still distinct bugs in the code. There were also many design goals not fully met. In reflection, there are elements which could have been better prepared. The team distribution could have been more balanced, the design goals could have been clearer, and the scope could have been reduced (though this was something I tried to keep in mind while designing it). I still believe creating a GlowLime game in a single semester is possible, but it requires a very well excuted combination of manageable scope, an experienced team, and proper project management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <i>Lucid</i> was a project I picked up partway through the Fall Semester. The Programming team was struggling (as many of our programming teams at GlowLime do), and I stepped in to assume a Lead Programmer role. The team sometimes struggled to find its footing, and the gameplay experience we finished is not fully complete. Nonetheless, I'm proud of the programming work I put into the project and I still believe it was potential. We at least reached a state where the current experience is playable, even if not fully clear in terms of gameplay objectives. <i>Lucid</i> was created by an Amherst College student, Mashi Zaman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <i>Progress or Die</i> was a project which accompanied an event I'll discuss later on, <i>GlowLime: Winter Studio</i>. It was created by Hampshire Student, Matt Regan. As a project, the scope began too large, and given our limited production timeline (roughly three weeks), we were too slow to trim the scope down to a reasonable amount. Another struggle for me, was the structure of the Programming team. With largely varied levels of experience, it was hard to properly lead the team and also deliver a functional product. I switched from extreme to extreme, initially putting too much time into the task management aspect of the role, and then spending nearly all my time on actual tasks near the end (sacrificing a degree of leadership and mentorship which had originally accompanied the role). As a proof of concept for a more fulltime work experience during January, I still believe the project was successful. However, like the others before it, it's still less than fully complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <i>Letters to Reid</i> was created by a Hampshire student, Martha Hollister, as her Division III. The core concept of exploring how we cope with grief and the loss of loved ones through a game was a very intriguging to me. It was also a project which I related to on a personal level. As with the other projects, I served as Lead Programmer. There were challenges, much like the rest of the projects, but we still managed to create a playable experience. My main work on the project was a map parsing system which could read in maps from spreadsheets and generate them at runtime. This tool was an example of symbosis between Design and Programming. Enabling the designers to more easily execute concepts without increasing the workload on programming. From a programming standpoint, this demonstrates one of my major successes this semester: designing tools and systems which support tunable input from design. This allows for a great deal of flexibility and empowers the iterative process of game development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         With <i>Pickup Pup</i>, created by Smith College student, Sam Luangkhot, I believe I also succeeded in maintaing a proper symbiosis between Design and Programming. Here again I'm serving as the Lead Programmer for the team, a role I've now held for every major project in my Division III. A majority of the games data is stored in spreadsheets giving design full control the manipulate . Im also very happy with the structure of the code. Along with Grace Barrett-Snyder, formerly one of the programmers, and now the producer of the team, we've built a very specific and orderly style guide for the codebase (stored in our <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ttSUVEkPV_-CHaR-cPHDsfMP--SItO5tQCExaOT_jU/">Technical Design Document</a>.) Given the consistency in style of the code, and the object-oriented principles we've adhered to, I feel as though the <a href = "https://github.com/PickupPup/Pickup-Pup">codebase</a> exemplifies the programming conventions I've learned and developed during my time at Hampshire. The team itself is also much smaller, and tighter knit that the teams on official GlowLime projects. Given this project is not affiliated with GlowLime, we're afforded a level of selectivity which GlowLime's inclusive structure does not permit. This has allowed us to create a more professional and experienced team than some found at GlowLime. Overall, this has made the development process much more effecient. The goal is to complete all major development work on the game by the end of May, and we seem on good track to meet this goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Throughout the games I've worked on during my time in Division III, I've seen the concept of compromise above all. Compromising for time's sake. Comprise between members of teams. Approaching game development with a level of flexibility seems key. On the converse, holding onto ideas or features too desparately often materializes as a detriment to the process.

                         Events
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                         During my time at GlowLime we've hosted and attended a variety of events. These events break down into three main categories:
                         <ul>
                              <li>
                                   GlowLime Project Events
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                   Speaker Events
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                   Showcase Events
                              </li>
                         </ul>
                    <p>
                         The most important of these three is easily the official Project Events. These events: our Pitch & Interest Meetings and All Team Meetings are key to the operation of GlowLime. The Pitch & Interest meeting is a time for student developers from across the Five Colleges to come and pitch their concepts to GlowLime. They present the game ideas and lay out the kind of team they need to complete work on the game (among other logistics).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Speaker events are also very useful as they expose students to industry perpsectives and different aspects of game development. This year alone we've hosted Pat King, CEO of <a href = "http://woodpenny.com/">Woodpenny</a>; Paul Hake, CEO of <a href = "http://www.hitpointstudios.com/">HitPoint Studios</a>; and James Portnow, creator of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz">Extra Credits</a>. We also work to promote and encourage students to attend the <a href = "http://pvgd.org/">Pioneer Valley Game Developer</a> MAKE! TALK! PLAY! events which happen every month. Introducing students to professional developers is a key part of the experience.
                    </p>
                         For Showcasing events, GlowLime has presented at <a href = "http://www.gameacon.com/">Gameacon</a>, <a href = "http://gamepile.org/">Woo! Game Pile</a>, and <a href = "http://www.massdigi.org/">MassDiGI's</a> Made in MA PAX party. Attending these events is supported by Hampshire's CLA (Campus Leadership and Activities) department. Since the establishment of the student group, GlowLime Games: Hampshire Division, the CLA support has been invaluable to GlowLime's ongoing efforts. While we remain dedicated to serving the Five Colleges, we recognize many of our Managers and Collaborators are based in Hampshire. Being reigstered as a student group has proved useful multiple times over. Thanks to CLA funding, we're able to journey to Worcester, Boston, and even New Jersey to attend these events. This is another excellent opportunity for students to see more of the local game development industry. It's also an excellent chance for them to demo the games they've been developing and get feedback from other developers and gaming enthusiasts.

                    <h2>
                         Legacy
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                         The concept of legacy has always been an important component at GlowLime. One of the main ways we've worked to secure the organization's ongoing integrity is through hiring dedicated student managers who will continue on the efforts as the current students graduate. The main choice here was promoting Joel Esquilin to Executive Director. I served in the role throughout my third year, and for the first semester of my Division III. Joel took over for me in December. He's been doing an excellent job so far. The intent in promoting him before I graduated was to continue provide a level of support, but still give him the full leadership. My hope is this will best prepare him for the coming year when GlowLime is primarily his responsibility (until which time he chooses a successor for the Executive Director role). Across the Management team, we've been working to find younger students to join and learn the logistics of the positions. We've been working to make the process of onboarding as seamless as possible. The first step is getting them setup with all our collaboration tools (Slack, Trello, Google Drive). Then, exposing them to the expectations and requirements of the roles gradually. I've also been training Hyeonseok Cho to replace me as Technical Director. Ultimately, the ongoing success of GlowLime depends on having students who are passionate enough to lead it. However, I think we've established a solid foundation and structure throughout its first two years of operation. Hopefully this will be enough to ensure its longevity at Hampshire and the Five Colleges at large.

                    <p>
                         I mentioned compromise before when discussing the games I've worked on. This has been a theme throughout working on GlowLime as a whole. Finding the proper compromise between time, quality, and team. This balance is hard to maintain, sometimes impossible. However, I've found the situations where I've been unwilling to compromise, had the worst outcomes. Having served in a variety of leadership of roles during my Division III, I still think there are times when it's necessary to take a strong stance, but being flexible is far more important. Game development, just like any other collaborative, is largely dependent on team dynamics. Sometimes team dynamics are unstable simply based on the personalities and dispositions of team members. Here again, finding ways to compromise and work around/mediate such conflicts is important. We've had such situations arise at GlowLime and have done our best to handle them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I've also learned a great deal about programming, specifically as it relates to games. The way compromise is most apparent in the discipline is balancing clean, organized code versus overall development time. Personally, I'm more interested in creating the best structured code. However, I've learned there are times when this is not feasible, and there is always the bottom line of whether or not the code works. It's a hard balance to strike, just like the rest of the aformentioned considerations. However, I generally find I've developed techniques and methods for creating clear, clean structures effeciently while still delivering them in time. One of the ways I've done this is by developing a pool of classes and systems I can reuse between the various Unity projects I work on. Having a majority of the basic code written so I can reuse it across projects has saved a great amount of development time. I've also found that building flexible/solid foundations of code has greatly paid off later in the development cycle. Initially, it always seems fastest to write code just to accomplish the present requirements. However, it's also important to anticipate how the requirements of a system can change, and design code be as flexible as possible in this situations. Especially for longer term projects, this minimizes the amount of overhead needed to go back and make changes to a system after it's already written. This is often where a bulk of the time cost comes. Building a system from the ground up is relatively quick, whereas changing an existing system can be very time consuming based on how it's designed.

                         I believe it's important to frame Division III and GlowLime and as a final extension the games produced within GlowLime as experiments. All the projects, and GlowLime as a whole constitute a mix of successes and failures. Learning why aspects failed and why other suceeded is key. I hope through the variety of experiences I've had in game development, specfically software engineering, I've discovered many pitfalls which some don't stumble upon until they're working their first professional job. I also feel that I have failed and made enough missteps as a leader to see how to improve there as well. However, there are also the successes which deserve recognition. I was a major contributor in creating a game development organization at Hampshire and in the Five Colleges, where none had existed before. We managed to make at least three games per semester for the last three semesters. All of these games reached various states of playable. I'm proud of the work I've done. And incredibly proud and grateful of the work all the other contributors gave to GlowLime. To thank all the individual managers, collaborators, and advisors who put time into making GlowLime what it now is would take many more pages. At the very least, I can say this was the most valuable part of the experience. Getting the chance to work with so many other talented developers and organizers, to meet so many new people, and to learn so many new things from others was easily the most valuable part of the experience.
