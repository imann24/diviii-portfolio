                         The concept for my Division III began as a game idea. However, the more I thought about it, I realized I lacked many of the skills necessary to make a complete game. This morphed into the concept of assembling a team to make such a game, but as I considered this further, I realized Hampshire currently lacked the structure for forming such teams. This spawned the idea that would crystalize into my Division III. GlowLime Games

                    <p>
                         GlowLime was intended to serve students interested in game development coming from all disciplines and at all levels of experience. It would provide educational, hands-on experience in game development.

                         I believe collaboration makes for the best projects. There is the often used African Proverb: “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” This certainly applies to game development. I’ve often found it’s quicker to throw myself into work solo without the checks and balances of a team. However, working on projects solo, especially projects as the scale of full games guarantees there will be elements missing. Working on a dedicated team offers a superior chance these elements do not go unexplored. For Design, it offers a degree of critique and fine tuning that is hard, if not impossible achieve with a solo blueprint. For Art and Audio, there is a level of quality control where acutely trained eyes and ears can survey the work being put into the game. And for programming, where I’ve spent a bulk of my time, there is a different type of quality control. Reviewing code to ensure it’s efficient, comprehensible, and maintainable.

                         Glowlime is in a large part based off the LiveCode program at Becker College by MassDiGI. Each semester, they place students on development teams to work on projects (typically pre-existing ones) and meet specific goals through the semester. The key way in which GlowLime distinguishes itself is that it’s student run. Whereas MassDiGI has a full-time team dedicated to its success, GlowLime’s Management is staffed  by students from the Five Colleges. This comes with its drawbacks and benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The benefit of having a student lead organization is the direct peer-to-peer communication. We regularly talk to our fellow students and can get feedback and input on how GlowLime as an organization is being run. This feedback loop ideally leads to an organization which meets the needs and wants of the student body at large.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         A student run organization  is not without its limitations. One of the main limiting factors is time. None of the students on the Management team can devote themselves in a fulltime capacity to the project.  The has always been a limiting factor on the scale/quantity of work GlowLime can accomplish. This is a limitation placed on all student organizations, but GlowLime runs a particular gamut between student group and startup that is hard to execute ideally. In many ways, it is a student club like any other. However, its goal is also to produce polished, professional games, and to provide students with a simulation of professional work experience
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         These expectations bring with them a degree of rigor not always found in student organizations. At many times, I feel GlowLime fell short of offering the professional standards to which it aspired. We endeavored to maintain professional production timelines, host organized events, and create polished games. There were distinct successes, but also many moments where we fell short of these goals. It was hard to motivate students participating, both at a Management level and Collaborator level to put in the necessary time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Collaborators at GlowLime are the developers who create the games. Like the Management team, the work is entirely volunteer based (though we worked w/ Ira to establish independent study credit for those students who were interested in obtaining it). Some Collaborators turned out to be exemplary workers, but others were either too inexperienced or did not have the time to commit to be a contributing member of a game development team. I think this is one of the important learning aspects of GlowLime. While the experience may be valuable for some, for others, it may show them that they don’t have the dedication or the motivation to work in games professionally. Much as GlowLime itself is an experiment in organizing groups of students to work on games, it also provides a space for students to experiment and see whether this is the kind of work they want to do professionally.

                         I’ve worked on five major game projects for my Division III this year:
                         <br><br><b>Fall 2016</b>
                         <ul>
                              <li>
                                   Defender’s Light
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                   Lucid
                              </li>
                         </ul>
                         <b>Winter 2017</b>
                         <ul>
                              <li>
                                   Progress or Die
                              </li>
                         </ul>
                         <b>Spring 2017</b>
                         <ul>
                              <li>
                                   Letters to Reid
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                   Pickup Pup
                              </li>
                         </ul>
                         All of the projects were made in Unity. Four of them were official GlowLime Games projects. The fifth was a GlowLime Match title. Three out of the five were mobile games, while the rest were targeting PC. I realize many Division III students typically focus on one game project throughout their Division III studies. For me, these different games served different purposes.

                    <p>
                          <i>Defender's Light</i> was my flagship project. It was my own design and a chance for me to run a GlowLime project to the specifications I thought appropriate. I also wanted to test whether a GlowLime project could be brought from concept within a single semester of development. The results were mixed. On one hand, the game is playable and shipped. However, it was not without its compromises. Many of the art assets are still unfinished and there are still distinct bugs in the code. There were also many design goals not fully met. In reflection, there are elements which could have been better prepared. The team distribution could have been more balanced, the design goals could have been clearer, and the scope could have been reduced (though this was something I tried to keep in mind while designing it). I still believe creating a GlowLime game in a single semester is possible, but it requires a very well excuted combination of manageable scope, an experienced team, and proper project management.

                         <i>Lucid</i> was a project I picked up partway through the Fall Semester. The Programming team was struggling (as many of our programming teams at GlowLime do), and I stepped in to assume a Lead Programmer role. The team sometimes struggled to find its footing, and the gameplay experience we finished is not fully complete. Nonetheless, I'm proud of the programming work I put into the project and I still believe it was potential. We at least reached a state where the current experience is playable, even if not fully clear in terms of gameplay objectives. <i>Lucid</i> was created by an Amherst College student, Mashi Zaman.

                         <i>Progress or Die</i> was a project which accompanied an event I'll discuss later on, <i>GlowLime: Winter Studio</i>. As a project, the scope began too large, and given our limited production timeline (roughly three weeks), we were too slow to trim the scope down to a reasonable amount. Another struggle for me, was the structure of the Programming team. With largely varied levels of experience, it was hard to properly lead the team and also deliver a functional product. I switched from extreme to extreme, initially putting too much time into the task management aspect of the role, and then spending nearly all my time on actual tasks near the end (sacrificing a degree of leadership and mentorship which had originally accompanied the role). As a proof of concept for a more fulltime work experience during January, I still believe the project was successful. However, like the others before it, it's still less than fully complete.
